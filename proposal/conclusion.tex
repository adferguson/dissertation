\chapter{Conclusion}

The design and configuration of today's networks is already informed
by application needs (\eg,
networks with full-bichapter bandwidth for MapReduce-type frameworks,
or deadline-based queuing~\cite{Ballani:2011} for interactive web services).
\sys provides a way for the network to solicit and react to such needs
automatically, dynamically, and at a finer timescale than with human input.
To do this, our design overcomes the two challenges of decomposing network
control, and resolving conflicts between users' needs.

%Reiterate how \sys is about exposing network capabilities and information
%to the end-users. We believe that it can be used as a building-block for other
%proposals, and it could be integrated alongside other applications in an SDN
%controller (eg, load-balancing, Hotel/Campus authentication portals, firewalls
%and other security applications such as the HoneyNet work, etc.)
